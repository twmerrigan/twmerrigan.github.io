A hundred years ago the British writer Virginia Woolf and her husband Leonard bought a £19 printing press. They were following through on one of three promises the couple had made on Virginia's 33rd birthday. (The other two were to buy Hogarth House and bulldog they would name John.) They reveled in the power that having a printing press at their disposal gave them. Virginia would now be able to publish whatever she liked, without having to go through her half-brother and publisher Gerald Duckworth. Leonard also found himself taken with the possibilities of the press. “I should never do anything else, you cannot think how exciting, soothing, ennobling and satisfying it is," he wrote in a letter. In July 1917, a few months after purchasing the printing press, the couple would publish a pamphlet containing a short story from each of them. *Two Stories* was the first installment in what would be a long history for Hogarth Press. 

If you don't know me well, you might wonder why I've chosen to start a blog post on my decision to learn front-end web development with an anecdote from the early twentieth century. Well, believe it or not, my learning coding has been strongly influenced by this bit of literary history. As a writer and journalist, I have published on websites run and controlled by others. What I write and how I write is determined by an editor most times. And because finding a foothold in the journalism world is so difficult, a writer is driven to write more like everyone else  — the middle region of the bell curve — rather than write his or her own unique voice. Therefore, I'm going to spend about 20 hours a week teaching myself to code. I want to control the means of production for my craft, not be at its mercy.
